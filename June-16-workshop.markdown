We had our first workshop on June 16th 2014.

Here are notes I (@julien51) took during the workshop. Feel free to fork and add yours too!


### Bloglovin:

RSS: "Taking someting bueatiful and making it ugly"

RSS is easy to avoir searching => aggregation and make it prett.

What's next for RSS? discovery

RSS creates equality and level play field.
RSS = Read Social Smart

Smart: analytics => suggestions
Giving traffic back is important to the publishers

### Google

20bn pages/day index
Optimization problem: how do we increase that? Limited bandwidth

Schema for Google=
- Link to webpage = connection between RSS & Web
- Fresh content all the time (15 minutes max... or seconds)
- Coverage with RSS is good!
- Building reader is easier than search engines
- THE WEB WAS NOT DESIGN FOR MACHINES
- RSS WAS BUILT FOR MACHINES

They just need PubSubHubbub (a service) of reader without frontend. And they can share this with other readers.


Google search depends on RSS => fresher content and saves resources

- Coverage needs to be improved (private content?, not accessible content...)
- Signal vs. content? Signa mostly + meta data nice to have.

Problem of take down content.


### Superfeedr

Following a feed is too damn hard and *impossible* on mobile devices. We need to keep decentralization and make it simple(r) than silos.
[SubToMe](http://subtome.com/) is our solution, but we need to build trust around it by "putting" it into some kind of open web foundation.


### Flipboard

Helping publishers with a good validator so they can 'fine tune' their feed.
David says we need to simplify the RSS "spec" to its bare minimum if we want to revitalize it.
