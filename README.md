Reboot RSS
==========

Reboot RSS is a community of people from both the publishing world and the feed consuming world which aims at rebooting RSS feeds.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate. Please join us. We also gather in the "physical" world. The first workshop is on June 16th 2014. Notes will be posted here.

This repository includes ideas and discussions! Please (ab)use the [issues section](https://github.com/Reboot-RSS/reboot-rss/issues)
